## One-liner of your idea
Beehive Data Analytics


## What problem are you solving? Describe the problem you're addressing and its significance in the market or industry
30% of bee colonies are dying every year, affecting global crop pollination and food security, caused by lack of information and inefficient beekeeping practices


## Describe the prototype you’ll be developing. Outline its specific objectives, goals, features, and functionalities

**Objective:** Develop a comprehensive alerts system for beekeepers that monitors critical hive parameters and delivers actionable notifications.

**Core Features:**
- **Multi-source data integration:** Real-time monitoring of hive weight and temperature via IoT sensors, plus bee activity detection through entrance cameras using computer vision
- **Intelligent alert engine:** Both simple threshold-based alerts (weight loss >2kg, temperature >35°C) and AI-driven anomaly detection for complex behavioral patterns
- **Multi-channel notifications:** Email and SMS delivery with customizable urgency levels and scheduling
- **Colony-specific configuration:** Individual alert rules per hive with historical context and seasonal adjustments

**Goals:** Enable proactive hive management by detecting critical events like swarming preparation, robbing attacks, varroa mite infestations, and environmental stress before they cause colony loss. The system transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights, reducing manual inspection frequency while improving colony survival rates.

**Target Users:** Commercial beekeepers managing 10+ colonies who need scalable monitoring solutions.

## Identify up to three potential risks and challenges that may arise during the development process and how you would mitigate those risks
Risk 1: Hardware Integration Complexity IoT sensors may have connectivity issues in outdoor conditions.

Mitigation: Implement error handling, offline buffering, and extensive field testing. Develop fallback alert systems using manual input.

Risk 2: Low Market Adoption Rate Beekeepers are conservative and may resist new technology.

Mitigation: Start with early adopters, create ROI case studies, offer freemium model, partner with beekeeping associations.

Risk 3: False Alert Accuracy Issues AI detection may produce false positives/negatives, damaging user trust.

Mitigation: Begin with reliable threshold alerts. Gradually introduce ML features with user feedback loops and confidence scoring.

## Please describe your product market potential

Market Size: Europe: 13M colonies (EU27) with 20-25% annual losses. Middle East: Turkey 8M, Iran 6M colonies, 25-30% losses. Combined 27M colonies. U.S. crisis: record 60% commercial losses (2024-2025), up from 17.7-76.2% previous year - 1.7M colonies died.

Core Problem: Traditional beekeeping requires "hard, frequent, unscalable work" - weekly 20kg hive inspections in protective suits. European beekeepers managing cross-border apiaries cannot scale monitoring. U.S. winter losses: 40.2% (2024-2025). Varroa mites, viruses, pesticides drive crisis. Priority issues: observability (100%), unscalable operations (90%), overwintering collapse (80%).

Disruption Opportunity: European/Middle Eastern markets lack integrated solutions. Gratheon's IoT + computer vision + AI alerts transforms reactive to predictive management, potentially preventing 20-30% losses across 27M+ colonies during critical period.

## Who are your main competitors? Define what sets your product apart from competitors. Highlight your product's benefits and value proposition

Main Competitors: BeeHero (Israel) - IoT sensors lacking video integration. Beewise (Israel) -
400/month), expensive all-or-nothing model. Broodminder - hobbyist IoT with limited enterprise features. Purple Hive/ApicAI - basic entrance monitoring.

Key Differentiation: Only integrated platform combining IoT + video analysis + AI insights. Modular approach allows incremental adoption vs expensive robotic systems. AI-driven alerts detect complex behavioral patterns (swarming, pest intrusions) competitors miss.

Competitive Advantages: Real-time edge computer vision with published research. Serves underserved mid-market (10-100 hives) between hobbyist tools and enterprise robotics. Cost efficient: €300-800 hardware vs €15,000+ robotics. Only solution providing environmental + behavioral monitoring with AI correlation

## Describe your paying customers and the users of your solution

Primary - Commercial Beekeepers (5-100 hives): Pollination services (90% income), honey secondary. Own specialized equipment, maintain warehouses, hire workers, use mobile apiaries. Pain points: scaling inspections, managing distant locations, preventing colony losses. Willingness: €200-500/month for proven ROI.

Secondary - Tech-Savvy Hobbyists: 1-10 hives seeking data insights. Motivated by bee welfare/learning over economics. Often engineers comfortable with technology. Value education and behavioral analysis. Price sensitivity: €50-150/month with ease-of-use focus.

Tertiary: Urban beekeepers (neighbor-friendly monitoring), farmers (pollination verification), research institutions (behavior studies), new beekeepers (guidance).

User Personas: Industrial operator (200+ hives, 5 locations) needs scalable monitoring. Semi-commercial (25 hives) wants early warnings. Tech enthusiast (5 hives) desires behavioral analytics

---

## Pricing Strategy and Revenue Model
SaaS Tiers: Starter €15/month - web app, basic management, 10 hives (hobbyists). Professional €49/month - IoT integration, analytics, alerts, 50 hives (semi-commercial). Enterprise €149/month - unlimited hives, entrance observers, AI insights, priority support (commercial).

Hardware Revenue: IoT scales €300-400 (70% margins). Entrance cameras €600-800 (60% margins). Installation €50-100/deployment.

Projections: Year 1: 40 customers (€25 ARPU) = €12K ARR. Year 2: 150 customers (€35 ARPU) = €63K ARR. Year 3: 400 customers (€45 ARPU) = €216K ARR. Hardware: 100 units/year by Year 2 = €40K.

ROI Justification: Preventing single colony loss ($200-500) justifies annual subscription. Reduced labor (2 hours/hive/month at €20/hour) = €480 savings/hive. 5-hive operation: €2,400 savings vs €588 Professional cost = 300% ROI.
