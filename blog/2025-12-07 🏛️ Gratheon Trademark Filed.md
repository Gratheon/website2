We've filed trademark registration for Gratheon with the Estonian Patent Office (Patendiamet) in Nice classes 9 (hardware/software), 42 (SaaS platform), and 7 (robotics).

## What This Means

Brand protection in Estonia establishes formal intellectual property foundation as we prepare for angel investment discussions and deploy IoT hardware to beekeepers. As we expand across EU markets, we'll pursue EU-wide protection through EUIPO.

## Protected Classes

**Class 9 - Electronic Apparatus**
- Beehive scales (IoT sensor devices)
- Entrance Observer (camera hardware)
- Mobile and web applications
- Robotic inspection apparatus

**Class 42 - Software Services**
- SaaS platform for apiary management
- AI bee detection and health analysis
- Cloud data storage and analytics
- Time-series metrics processing

**Class 7 - Machinery**
- Robotic Beehive inspection platform
- Automated lifting mechanisms
- Robotic Apiary systems

## Timeline

- **Filed:** December 7, 2025 with Patendiamet (Estonian Patent Office)
- **Cost:** €300 for 3 classes
- **Coverage:** Estonia
- **Expected registration:** Q2 2026 (2-3 months examination + 3 months opposition period)
- **Valid for:** 10 years from registration
- **Renewal:** 2036

The ® symbol will be added to our branding once registration is confirmed. We're evaluating EU-wide filing (€1,000) as we scale beyond Estonian borders.

## Why Now

As we prepare for our €40k angel round and deploy IoT hardware to beekeepers in the field, having protected intellectual property:
- Strengthens investor confidence with formal IP
- Prevents brand confusion in our home market
- Establishes legal foundation for expansion (EU-wide filing considered as we scale)
- Protects both hardware innovations and software services under one unified brand
- Cost-effective approach: €300 for Estonian protection vs €1,000 for EU-wide

While we maintain our open source philosophy for code (AGPL license), protecting the Gratheon brand ensures that our identity and market positioning remain distinct as we scale.
