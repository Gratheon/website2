## Feedback from mentors

It's crucial to define the target demographic before proceeding further. Trying to cater to both experienced beekeepers and tech novices may dilute the efforts and hinder progress. Instead, focusing on a specific target audience will allow for more effective product development and marketing strategies.

While the solution's AI and IT aspects show promise, there's a pressing need for expertise in user experience (UX) design to enhance usability and user satisfaction. Additionally, collaborating with a partner specializing in mechatronics or hardware can improve the prototype's functionality and overall performance.

It seemed that the team's ambition may be holding them back from fully realizing the potential of their idea. Encouragement and motivation are essential to inspire greater ambition and drive. Building a cohesive and motivated team will be instrumental in overcoming challenges and propelling the idea forward to success
