Goal of this feature is to predict [❄️ Overwintering collapse](../../../about/problems/biological/❄️%20Overwintering%20collapse.md) at winter time and detect [🗃️ Poor hive ventilation](../../../about/problems/🗃️%20Poor%20hive%20ventilation.md) at summer time by measuring temperature from inside the hive.

If temperature drops below certain user-configureable threshold, we can alert a beekeeper as this is an anomaly. Beekeeper in that case can try to do some mitigation actions: 
- inspect the hive for ventilation issues
- inspect colony as lacking resources and dying
- move hive inside a garage

# How it works
- IoT sensor periodically sends metrics to gratheon app
- We analyze data patterns
- We send [alerts](../../web_app/pro-tier/alerts.md) in case of anomalies
