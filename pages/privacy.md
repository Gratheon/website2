|twk_idm_key, twk_uuid_*, TawkConnectionTime|Support chat (tawk.to) integration|

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. The table above lists the primary cookies currently used by our application and their purposes.

In addition to cookies, our application (including the desktop version) utilizes **Local Storage** in your browser or application environment. Local Storage allows us to save small amounts of data directly on your device, such as authentication tokens (to keep you logged in) and user interface preferences (like view settings). This data persists even after you close your browser or the application. Unlike cookies, data stored in Local Storage is not automatically sent to our servers with every request.

Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. You can also typically clear Local Storage through your browser's settings, though doing so may log you out or reset your preferences. If you choose to remove cookies/local storage or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites or Apps.

</div>

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year past the termination of the user's account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

### 8. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?

<div class="summary-box">
<p><strong>💡 In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.</p>

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites or Apps is at your own risk.

### 9. How Do We Handle Offline Data Storage?

<div class="summary-box">
<p><strong>💡 In Short:</strong> Our application stores data locally on your device to enable offline functionality.</p>
</div>

To provide a seamless experience even without an internet connection, our application utilizes browser storage mechanisms, specifically IndexedDB (managed via Dexie.js), to store application data locally on your device. This includes data you input, such as hive inspections, as well as data fetched from our servers.

This local storage allows you to access and interact with your data while offline. When a connection is re-established, the application synchronizes this local data with our servers.

Please be aware that the security of data stored locally on your device depends on you maintaining the security of your device and browser environment. We recommend using standard security practices like device passwords and keeping your browser updated.

### 10. Do We Collect Information from Minors?

<div class="summary-box">
<p><strong>💡 In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

By using the Sites or Apps, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Sites or Apps. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

### 12. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
