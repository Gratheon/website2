## Elevator pitch
### Problem
Did you know that on average 20% to 40 % of bee colonies die every year. They die from hunger, [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](problems/biological/🦀%20Infestations.md), late  [🧶 Swarming](problems/biological/🧶%20Swarming.md) or because beekeeper was too tired to lift heavy beehives to inspect them every 1-2 weeks.

## Solution
My name is Artjom we at Gratheon develop a new type of beehive that inspects the bees automatically. It consists of 3 devices that send data about beehive and an app that analyzes weight, images and video with AI and alerts the user to improve awareness and prevent collapse.

### Team and traction
We are targeting [👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](company/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) in Europe and offer SaaS.  
We are a [small team](company/Team/index.md) are engineers and researchers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me, Taltech.  We are open source and had [lots of volunteers](volunteer.md). We have around 200 registered users.

### Ask
By our calculation the market opportunity for a single device is over 150M ARR euros in Europe alone. We are raising 40 thousands euros in pre-seed angel investments to bootstrap our product.  Join us to help 2 million beekeepers and their cute & fuzzy bees.
