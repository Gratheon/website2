### Version history
![](../../img/436202645_10161734083722973_395574856169740131_n.jpg)
Prototype v4 at field testing. Camera has protective case. Missing the landing board protective cone as it needs artificial lighting

![](../../img/gatehousev3.jpg)
Prototype v3. Added protective cone, now idea is to have CPU/GPU block separated and moved into the hive roof to have less devices on the entrance, have camera integrated with the cone, have WIFI antennae and power blocks farther away from the bees.

![](../../img/1000004899.jpg)
Prototype v1 version. Camera at the center on a monopod, jetson orin nano at the center with wiring and antennae facing down
