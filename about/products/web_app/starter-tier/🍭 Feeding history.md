So the goal of this set of features is to allow beekeeper to mark colony as having a treatment (sugar syrup, tymol candy etc.). This is very similar to [Varroa Treatment diary](https://www.notion.so/Varroa-Treatment-diary-90030bfde0c749ce922d43a2d46c273a?pvs=21).

This has separate task for [Automatic sugar syrup feeder](https://www.notion.so/Automatic-sugar-syrup-feeder-76aed0471afd4f9fa41c10a6b557c451?pvs=21)

## User story - overwintering

- In september, as a beekeeper, I need to feed to my bee colony in hive X to prevent starvation over winter
    
- I add new section - horizontal feeder
    
    - alternatively - a vertical feeder within an existing section
- I pour sugar syrup. Could be 5L or more, depends on the quantity
    
- I mark this colony as having a `sugar syrup` and as `5L`
    
- Later I add 2 times more `5L`
    
- App displays `last feeding time` in Apiary list view (new column needed)

- I get a reminder [Alerts](https://www.notion.so/Alerts-8b65dea8fc164a7f91b0a76fa0948189?pvs=21) if I added less than 10L of sugar syrup in september and 5 days have passed since last feeding (to remind to feed fully)
    

## User story - starving colony

- In june, I as a beekeeper get a new colony
- the colony lacks sufficient resources and needs extra feeding
- I add `tymol candy` (a white sugary substance) as `1KG`
- I add this to one of the sections (I prefer to add it in roof)
- I’m marking it down in the app
