Your strongest hive shows signs of preparing to swarm? Quickly split it by selecting frames with brood and bees, creating a new colony while keeping the parent hive productive.

**Expand Your Apiary**
Turn one successful colony into two or more. Select the best frames with mixed brood, adequate food stores, and nurse bees to create strong nucleus colonies.

**Create Nucleus Colonies for Sale**
Build nucleus colonies for sale by selecting 3-5 quality frames with brood pattern, honey stores, and young bees. Track each nuc's origin for customer records.

#### 📋 Recommended Frame Selection

**For Nucleus Colony (3-5 frames):**
- 2 frames of brood (1 capped, 1 with eggs/larvae)
- 1 frame of honey
- 1 frame of pollen
- 1 foundation or drawn comb

**For Full Split (6-10 frames):**
- 3-4 frames of brood (mix of capped and open)
- 2-3 frames of food (honey/pollen stores)
- 2-3 frames with nurse bees
- 1-2 drawn combs or foundation
