title: 🗺️ Hive Placement Planner
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Plan optimal hive placement within your apiary by visualizing sun movement, shadow patterns, and spatial relationships. Prevent common placement mistakes before physically setting up your hives.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper planning my apiary layout
- I want to simulate sun movement and visualize shadows from trees and buildings
- So that I can position hives optimally for productivity while avoiding north-facing entrances and flight path collisions

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Sun Simulation**: Watch the sun move from East → South → West around an intuitive compass
- **Realistic Shadows**: See polygonal shadows cast by both obstacles and hives throughout the day
- **Interactive Canvas**: Drag hives and obstacles, rotate entrances, resize objects with visual handles
- **Instant Feedback**: All changes auto-save and update shadows in real-time
- **Flight Pattern Awareness**: Visual layout helps identify potential colony collision zones
- **Full-Width Canvas**: Responsive design uses entire screen width for detailed planning

### 💡 Use Cases

**New Apiary Setup**
Planning a new apiary location? Add trees and buildings as obstacles, then position hives to maximize morning sun exposure while avoiding afternoon heat and ensuring proper entrance orientation.

**Optimize Existing Layout**
Already have hives but experiencing issues? Use the planner to simulate better arrangements considering shadow patterns at different times of day before physically moving heavy hives.

**Expansion Planning**
Adding new hives to existing apiary? Visualize how new hives will interact with existing ones, ensuring flight paths don't cross and all hives get adequate sun exposure.

**Seasonal Adjustments**
Plan seasonal hive repositioning by simulating sun angles and shadow coverage, helping you decide which hives need more shade in summer or more sun in spring.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Navigate to Apiary** - Go to your apiary edit page
2. **Open Hive Placement tab** - Click "Hive Placement" in the tab menu
3. **Add Obstacles** - Click "Add Tree" or "Add Building" then click canvas to place
4. **Position Hives** - Drag hives to optimal locations
5. **Adjust Entrances** - Click hive, then drag blue rotation handle or use buttons
6. **Simulate Sun** - Move sun slider or enable auto-rotate to see shadow changes
7. **Refine Layout** - Resize/rotate obstacles by dragging their handles

#### 🎨 Visual Elements

**Hive Colors:**
- **Yellow** - Unselected hive
- **Green** - Selected hive (shows rotation handle)
- **Blue Arrow** - Entrance direction indicator

**Obstacle Handles:**
- **Blue Handle** - Drag to resize (all obstacles)
- **Orange Handle** - Drag to rotate (buildings only)
- **Gray Body** - Drag to move obstacle

**Sun Position:**
- **☀️ Emoji** - Rotates around compass (top-right)
- **90° (E)** - Morning sun, shadows point West
- **180° (S)** - Midday sun, shadows point North
- **270° (W)** - Evening sun, shadows point East

#### ⚠️ Placement Best Practices

**Hive Entrance Orientation:**
- ✅ **Best**: Southeast or South (morning sun, afternoon shade)
- ⚠️ **Acceptable**: East or Southwest  
- ❌ **Avoid**: North (cold, damp), West (overheating)
- ❌ **Never**: Facing walls or other hives directly

**Hive Spacing:**
- Minimum 3 feet apart (prevent drift)
- Stagger rows to avoid straight flight lines
- Consider wheelbarrow access between hives

**Shadow Management:**
- Morning sun is beneficial (activates foragers early)
- Afternoon shade helps in hot climates
- Avoid all-day shade (hives stay too cold)

**Wind Protection:**
- Use buildings/trees as windbreaks
- Don't block entrance airflow
- Leave evacuation routes for smoke

### ✨ Tips & Tricks

💡 **Test Different Times**: Use the sun slider to check morning, noon, and evening shadows before finalizing placement

💡 **Rotate in Small Steps**: Use rotation buttons for precise 15° adjustments when fine-tuning entrance direction

💡 **Plan for Growth**: Leave space between hives for adding supers during honey flow

💡 **Mark Problem Areas**: Place obstacles where you DON'T want hives (permanent structures, wet spots, slopes)

💡 **Save Multiple Layouts**: Take screenshots of different configurations to compare offline

### 🔄 Auto-Save
All changes (hive positions, rotations, obstacles) save automatically when you release the mouse. Reload the page anytime to continue planning exactly where you left off.
