Inventory management helps beekeepers track equipment, supplies, and beekeeping materials across multiple locations.

## Overview

Professional beekeepers need to manage significant inventory including:
- Beehive equipment (boxes, frames, feeders)
- Protective gear
- Treatment supplies (medications, organic acids)
- Feeding supplies (sugar, pollen substitute)
- Harvesting equipment
- Maintenance tools and spare parts

This system provides complete visibility into inventory levels, locations, usage patterns, and restocking needs.
