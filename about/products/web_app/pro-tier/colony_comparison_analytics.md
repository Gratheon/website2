title: ⚖️ Colony comparison analytics
---

Colony comparison analytics provides side-by-side comparison of multiple hives to identify trends, patterns, and performance differences.

## Overview

This feature helps beekeepers:
- Compare hive productivity and health across their apiary
- Identify best-performing queens and colonies
- Detect underperforming hives early
- Make data-driven decisions about queen replacement, feeding, and treatment
- Understand environmental impacts on different hives

## Comparison metrics

### Health indicators
- Brood pattern quality scores
- Disease detection frequency
- Varroa mite counts over time
- Queen presence and quality

### Productivity
- Honey production estimates
- Comb building progress
- Population growth rates
- Foraging activity levels

### Environmental data
- Temperature curves comparison
- Humidity patterns
- Weight changes (if scales connected)
- Activity patterns

### Management history
- Inspection frequency
- Treatment applications
- Feeding schedules
- Queen replacement history

## Features

### Visual comparisons
- Side-by-side charts for any metric
- Overlay multiple hive timeseries on one chart
- Heatmap views for apiary-wide comparisons
- Trend analysis and anomaly detection

### Statistical analysis
- Average, min, max values across selected hives
- Standard deviation and variance
- Correlation analysis between metrics
- Outlier detection

### Reporting
- Generate comparison reports for selected date ranges
- Export comparison data for external analysis
- Share comparison views with team members
- Schedule automated comparison reports

## Use cases

### Queen performance evaluation
Compare colonies with different queens to:
- Identify superior genetics
- Decide which queens to breed from
- Determine optimal queen replacement timing

### Treatment efficacy
After applying treatments:
- Compare treated vs control hives
- Measure treatment effectiveness
- Optimize treatment protocols

### Location analysis
Compare hives in different apiaries to:
- Assess forage quality by location
- Identify optimal apiary sites
- Plan apiary expansion

### Seasonal planning
Compare year-over-year performance to:
- Plan harvest timing
- Prepare for winter
- Optimize spring buildup management
