Need to explain all of the product features to the user

Created → [Product onboarding guide](https://www.notion.so/Product-onboarding-guide-dbbf8cbd92c4460eba134086a2f623fa?pvs=21)

## Suggested solution

- go through Notion core features
    
- record videos
    
- upload to youtube
    
- update Notion features to include these features as a description how it works with our product
    
- in web-app - create help icon ( `?` ) component which will aid in explaining how particular feature works
    
    - inject youtube video into the web-app within a `?` icons that should pop up a video in the corner
    - user should still be able to navigate and use the web-app as he is listening to the video (so its a not blocking modal)
    
    Example of design how videos can be embedded (in Pipedrive)
