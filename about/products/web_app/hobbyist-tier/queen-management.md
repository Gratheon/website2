title: 👑 Queen Management
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Track queen bee status, breeding information, and lifecycle stages to monitor colony reproductive health and understand brood patterns across your hives.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper managing multiple colonies
- I want to record queen presence, age, race, and lifecycle stage
- So that I can track reproductive health and plan queen replacement activities

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor queen development from cup through mating to laying stages
- **Breeding Records**: Track queen race, year marked, and genetic lineage
- **Timeline History**: See when queen was last spotted and status changes over time
- **Colony Diagnostics**: Understand if missing brood is due to queenless condition or unmated queen
- **Replacement Planning**: Know queen age to plan timely replacements

### 💡 Use Cases

**Track Queen Age**
Mark when you introduced a new queen and track her age. Plan replacement when she reaches 2-3 years old.

**Breeding Program**
Record queen race and breeding information for colonies you're selecting for desirable traits like gentleness or honey production.

**Diagnose Brood Issues**
When you notice missing brood, check queen status. Is the colony queenless, or is the queen unmated or old and infertile?

**Post-Split Management**
After splitting a colony, track whether the new colony has successfully raised a queen and when she began laying.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Mark queen presence** - Toggle queen present/absent on specific frames during inspection
2. **Record breeding info** - Add queen race, color mark, year introduced
3. **Update lifecycle stage** - Select current stage: virgin → mating → laying → old
4. **View timeline** - Check calendar showing queen sightings and status changes
5. **Link with AI** - AI queen detection automatically suggests queen presence

#### 👑 Queen Lifecycle Stages
- **Queen Cup**: Colony is raising a new queen
- **Virgin Queen**: Queen has emerged but not mated
- **Mating**: Queen is on mating flights
- **Laying Queen**: Queen is actively laying eggs
- **Old & Infertile**: Queen's egg production declining

#### 📅 Timeline Features
- Last seen dates for each queen
- Status change history
- Correlation with brood patterns
- Integration with inspection notes

### 🔍 Integration with Detection
When you upload frame photos, AI detection may identify queens. You can:
- Review AI suggestions in queen management
- Confirm or reject AI detections
- Manually mark queen presence if AI missed her
