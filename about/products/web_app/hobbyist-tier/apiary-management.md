title: 📦 Apiary Management
---
### 🎯 Purpose
Organize your hives by location or management group with apiaries - perfect for beekeepers managing multiple sites, tracking different locations, or organizing colonies by operational needs.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper with hives in multiple locations
- I want to group my hives into apiaries
- So that I can organize colonies by location and manage inspection routes efficiently

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Location-Based Organization**: Group hives by physical site, yard, or geographic location
- **Multi-Site Management**: Easily switch between different apiary locations
- **Inspection Planning**: Plan inspection routes by organizing hives into convenient groups
- **Flexible Grouping**: Create apiaries based on location, ownership, or management approach
- **GPS Tracking**: Track exact locations with map visualization

### 💡 Use Cases

**Multiple Locations**
Manage hives spread across your backyard, a friend's property, and a commercial location. Each apiary keeps hives organized by site.

**Commercial Operations**
Organize dozens of hives across multiple yards. Plan inspection routes by visiting one apiary at a time.

**Shared Beekeeping**
Separate your personal hives from those you manage for others by creating different apiaries.

**Seasonal Movement**
Track hives moved for pollination contracts by creating apiaries for different seasonal locations.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Create apiary** - Click "Add Apiary" from your dashboard
2. **Name your location** - Give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Backyard", "North Farm")
3. **Add location** - Optionally add GPS coordinates or address
4. **Add hives** - Create new hives within the apiary or move existing ones
5. **View on map** - See all your apiaries visualized on a map

#### 📍 Organization Tips
- Use clear location names (avoid generic names like "Apiary 1")
- Add GPS coordinates for remote locations
- Include notes about access, parking, or site conditions
- Group hives that you inspect together
