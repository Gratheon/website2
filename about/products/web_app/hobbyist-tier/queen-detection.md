title: 👑 Queen Detection
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Automatically detect queen bees in your frame photos using AI to help identify queenless colonies early and prevent colony loss.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper monitoring colony health
- I want AI to detect queens in my frame photos
- So that I can quickly identify queenless colonies and take corrective action before it's too late

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Early Detection**: Identify queenless colonies before they become laying workers
- **Time Saving**: No need to spot the queen manually in every photo
- **Historical Tracking**: Review past photos to see when queen was last detected
- **Peace of Mind**: Automated alerts when queen hasn't been seen in recent inspections

### 💡 Use Cases

**Queenless Colony Alert**
After splitting a hive, upload frame photos to verify the new colony has a queen or is raising one. Get immediate feedback if no queen is detected.

**Post-Winter Check**
In spring, quickly verify all colonies have surviving queens by uploading frame photos from each hive.

**After Swarm**
When a colony swarms, confirm the remaining queen or verify new queen cells are present.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Upload frame photo** - Take and upload photos during inspection
2. **Wait for analysis** - AI detection runs automatically (10-30 seconds)
3. **Review results** - Check detection overlay showing queen location
4. **Verify manually** - Confirm AI detection is accurate
5. **Track over time** - Use queen management to record queen presence

#### ⚠️ Current Limitations
- Detection accuracy is around 60% (model still in training)
- Works best with clear, well-lit photos
- May produce false positives
- Always verify AI detections visually
