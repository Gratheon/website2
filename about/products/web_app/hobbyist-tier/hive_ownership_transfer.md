---

Hive ownership transfer allows beekeepers to transfer complete hive records, history, and data to another user account within the Gratheon platform.

## Overview

This feature is useful when:
- Selling hives to other beekeepers
- Transferring management responsibilities within a commercial operation
- Gifting or donating hives
- Reorganizing apiaries across multiple user accounts

## How it works

1. Current owner initiates a transfer request from the hive management interface
2. System generates a transfer token or invitation link
3. Recipient accepts the transfer
4. All hive data, including inspection history, frames, photos, and telemetry data, is transferred to the new owner
5. Original owner loses access to the hive data (optional: can retain read-only access)

## What gets transferred

- Hive metadata (location, name, notes)
- Complete inspection history
- All frame data and uploaded photos
- AI analysis results
- Sensor/telemetry data history
- Treatment records
- Feeding history

## Permissions

- Only the hive owner can initiate a transfer
- Transfer can be cancelled before acceptance
- Both parties receive email notifications
- Transfer requires explicit acceptance from the recipient
