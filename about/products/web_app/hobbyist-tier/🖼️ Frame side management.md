title: 🖼️ Frame Side Management
---

### 🎯 Purpose
View and interact with your uploaded frame photos through an intuitive interface that lets you zoom, toggle detection overlays, and even draw annotations directly on your images.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper reviewing frame photos
- I want to zoom into details, toggle what I see, and mark areas of interest
- So that I can closely examine brood patterns, bee counts, and potential issues

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Smart Zoom**: Start with optimized preview, zoom in up to 20x for detailed inspection
- **Toggle Detections**: Show or hide AI detection overlays (bees, cells, queens, pests)
- **Draw & Annotate**: Mark areas of concern using mouse or iPad Pencil
- **Multi-Detection View**: See counts and locations of all detected objects in side panel
- **Progressive Loading**: Fast initial load with high-res images loaded as you zoom
- **Organized by Side**: Manage both sides of each frame independently

### 💡 Use Cases

**Detailed Brood Inspection**
Zoom into capped brood areas to check for spotty brood pattern or signs of disease. Toggle cell detection overlay to see exactly which cells AI classified as brood vs honey.

**Queen Hunting**
Can't spot the queen? Toggle queen detection overlay to see where AI thinks she might be. Zoom in to verify and mark her location with annotations.

**Pest Detection Review**
Review AI-detected varroa mites or hive beetles. Zoom into flagged areas to confirm or dismiss detections. Draw circles around confirmed pest locations.

**Compare Frame Sides**
View both sides of a frame side-by-side to understand the full picture of brood pattern, food stores, and bee population distribution.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Navigate to frame** - Select apiary → hive → box → frame
2. **Choose side** - Click "Left" or "Right" to view that side's photo
3. **View detections** - AI analysis results appear automatically
4. **Zoom in** - Use mouse wheel or pinch gesture to zoom (up to 20x)
5. **Toggle overlays** - Click detection types in side panel to show/hide
6. **Draw annotations** - Use pencil tool to mark areas of interest
7. **Undo/Clear** - Remove last annotation or clear all drawings
