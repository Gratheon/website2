title: 📦 Hive Management
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Create and manage individual hive records within your apiaries, tracking each colony's unique characteristics, equipment setup, and management history.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper managing multiple colonies
- I want to create and organize individual hive records
- So that I can track each colony separately with its own photos, notes, and equipment

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Digital Hive Records**: Create individual profiles for each colony with name, color, and notes
- **Visual Organization**: Color-code your hives to match physical paint colors for easy identification
- **Equipment Tracking**: Track boxes, frames, and sections within each hive structure
- **Colony History**: View complete timeline of inspections, photos, and activities per hive
- **Status Monitoring**: Mark hives as active, queenless, preparing to swarm, or collapsed
- **Device Integration**: Connect entrance observers, scales, and sensors to specific hives

### 💡 Use Cases

**New Hive Setup**
Got a new package or nuc? Create a hive record with its starting configuration (1 box, 10 frames), add photos of the first inspection, and track growth over time.

**Color-Coded Identification**
Paint your hives different colors? Set matching colors in the app so you can quickly identify which digital record corresponds to which physical hive in your yard.

**Multi-Hive Comparison**
Compare performance across hives in the same apiary. Which colony is bringing in the most pollen? Which needs feeding? Visual hive cards make comparison easy.

**Equipment Inventory**
Track how many boxes and frames each hive has. When adding supers or removing honey, update the hive structure to maintain accurate records.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Create a hive** - Click "Add Hive" within your chosen apiary
2. **Name your colony** - Give it a memorable name (or use auto-generated names)
3. **Choose colors** - Select colors matching your physical hive paint
4. **Set structure** - Define initial boxes and frame count
5. **Add notes** - Record colony origin, queen type, or special characteristics
6. **Track over time** - Add inspection records, photos, and observations

#### 🎨 Hive Identification Tips
- Use distinctive names: "Yellow Powerhouse", "South Corner", "Gentle Giants"
- Match digital colors to physical hive paint for easy field reference
- Add notes about hive location within apiary: "closest to gate", "under oak tree"
- Photo the hive exterior during setup for quick visual identification

### 📊 Hive Status Options
- **Active** - Normal, healthy colony
- **Queenless** - No queen detected, may need intervention
- **Preparing to Swarm** - Queen cells present, consider split
- **Weak** - Low bee population, may need support
- **Collapsed** - Colony died or absconded (historical record)

### 🔗 Integration Features
- Connect entrance observers to track bee traffic
- Link temperature/humidity sensors for environmental monitoring
- Associate scales for weight-based honey flow tracking
- View all sensor data in context of individual hive
