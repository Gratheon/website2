We are developing a robotic vertical beehive inspection platform, which is
- capable of lifting multiple hive sections to faster reach the nest
- take photos of the beehive frames with built-in cameras - manual hive frame lifting is needed
- uploading inspection result to the [web app](../web_app/web_app.md)
- transported on wheels, you can use it to inspect different hives

`status`: [TRL 2](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/)

### Problem focus
Out of all beekeeping issues, this product is helping with these:
- [👁️ Observability of bee colony](../../problems/core/👁️%20Observability%20of%20bee%20colony.md)
- [💀 Intrusive inspections](../../problems/💀%20Intrusive%20inspections.md)
- [💪🏻 Physical labor](../../problems/core/💪🏻%20Physical%20labor.md)
- [🦀 Infestations](../../problems/biological/🦀%20Infestations.md)
- [💀 Alcohol washing killing bees](../../problems/💀%20Alcohol%20washing%20killing%20bees.md)
- [💀 Colony without a queen](../../problems/💀%20Colony%20without%20a%20queen.md)
- [💀 Colony with drone-laying queen](../../problems/biological/💀%20Colony%20with%20drone-laying%20queen.md)
- [🗃️ Ugly beehives](../../problems/🗃️%20Ugly%20beehives.md)
- [🎒 Challenging to become a new beekeeper](../../problems/🎒%20Challenging%20to%20become%20a%20new%20beekeeper.md)

### Target clients

A robotic inspection platform will cost (>2000 EUR) and its main value is in digitalization and organization of the apiary state. It might be too cumbersome for [👨🏻‍🚒 Industrial beekeepers](../../company/clients/👨🏻‍🚒%20Industrial%20beekeepers.md) or [🧑🏻‍🌾 Farmers](../../company/clients/🧑🏻‍🌾%20Farmers.md) and too hard for [👨🏻 Potential new beekeepers](../../company/clients/👨🏻%20Potential%20new%20beekeepers.md). But it does look viable for:

- [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](../../company/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md)
- [👩🏼‍🏫 Urban beekeepers](../../company/clients/👩🏼‍🏫%20Urban%20beekeepers.md)
- [👩🏻 Corporate Hive Sponsorship Program](../../company/clients/👩🏻%20Tech%20scale-up%20companies.md)

## Non-functional requirements

Extraction should happen without disturbing the bees, exposing them to elements or risking people around.

- able to adjust to frame size and hive section size of customer’s choice (Langstroth, Farrar, National etc)
- should not harm human operator - @Regulations and Compliance (ex. breaking hands)
- not kill 🐝 bees [squashing with moving mechanisms, cause hypothermia, open to stealing or attacks via cracks]
- be able to extract frame if bees glued it with wax
- not 🔥 ignite from overheating, sun, electrical wiring etc. Beewax is highly flammable
- move frame that is full of honey (4kg)
- be repairable (modular, hot-swappable)
- be offline-first. Provide data to beekeeper without internet or cloud account
- provide manual on-site control over frame movement
- fallback to safe mode on power loss

## Prototype

Consists of actuators that can move the frame in/out, GPU, cameras. Very early stage as we’re focusing on [Web-app](https://www.notion.so/Web-app-2937ed264e1d434a8664caa4bc40978e?pvs=21) and [Entrance Observer](https://www.notion.so/Entrance-Observer-b0319799ab7744dc928c08119de4fc43?pvs=21) first.
