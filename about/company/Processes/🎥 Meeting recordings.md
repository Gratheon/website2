- Camera placement problem in [R**obotic Beehive**](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Beehive-fd9559a2950b44bc8291972299ced18e?pvs=21) to take photos
    - Requirements
        - needs to be from ready-made off-the-shelf components
        - needs to be minimal (as less motors and moving details as possible)
        - needs to support 200g camera at 400mm distance
        - needs to not block frame extraction
        - cameras have fixed focal distance, so they need to be in the center of the frame
    - Solution 1 - use fixed cameras + have good grip on the frame
    - Solution 2 - butterfly mechanism but no obvious components on the market are found yet
    - Solution 3 - some sort of extra linear actuators to move camera in
- Marketing promo video for [Inspection management](https://www.notion.so/Inspection-management-91984eebbfde4a52a5d9a3836a6a998e?pvs=21) feature
