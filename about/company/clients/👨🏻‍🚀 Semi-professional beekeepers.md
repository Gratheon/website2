## Profile

**⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ PRIMARY TARGET - Best Product-Market Fit**

Semi-professional beekeepers operate 10-50 hives, selling honey commercially while maintaining other income sources. This is Gratheon's sweet spot - they need automation but can't afford industrial solutions.

### Demographics
- Age: 35-60
- Location: Rural areas with own land
- Income: €30k-80k (beekeeping is 20-50% of income)
- Business: Registered company or sole proprietorship
- Experience: 5-15 years beekeeping

### Operation Scale
- **10-50 beehives** (sweet spot: 20-30 hives)
- 2-4 apiaries across different locations
- 500-2000 kg honey production per year
- Commercial sales to locals, markets, shops
- Some offer pollination services

### Equipment & Assets
- Motorized honey extractor (badger)
- Wax melter and processing equipment
- Storage facility (garage, barn, or dedicated space)
- Own land or long-term apiary leases
- Vehicle for transporting equipment
- Basic tools and protective gear

## Motivations

1. **Increase Efficiency** - More hives with same time investment
2. **Scale Revenue** - Grow from 20 to 50 hives profitably
3. **Reduce Labor** - Heavy lifting and frequent inspections are exhausting
4. **Prevent Losses** - Each lost colony = €100-200 in bees + lost honey production
5. **Professional Image** - Data-driven approach for B2B customers
6. **Better Timing** - Know exact intervention moments (swarm prevention, harvest)

## Pain Points

### Time & Labor
- Manual inspections every 7-14 days per apiary (full day per location)
- Heavy lifting (hive boxes 20-30kg each)
- Physical exhaustion limits scaling
- Inspections disturb bees and reduce honey production

### Financial Pressure
- Each colony loss = €150-300 (bees + equipment + lost production)
- 15-25% annual colony losses are common
- Honey prices competitive (€8-15/kg wholesale)
- Equipment costs high (€200-500 per new hive)
- Time = money (manual work doesn't scale)

### Knowledge Gaps
- Difficult to track 30+ colonies in detail
- Miss subtle signs of problems
- Forget which hive had which issue
- Hard to compare colony performance
- Lack data for decision-making

### Scaling Challenges
- Can't add more hives without more time
- Multiple apiary locations hard to monitor
- Hiring labor too expensive for semi-pro scale
- Want to grow but physically constrained

## Buying Behavior

**Decision Process:**
- Research online and in beekeeping groups (3-6 months)
- Wants to see proof from other beekeepers
- Tests with 1-3 hives before full adoption
- Expands to more hives if successful

**Budget:**
- **Per hive hardware:** €200-400 acceptable
- **Software:** €5-15/month or €50-150/year
- **Total investment:** €3,000-8,000 for 20 hives over 2 years

**Purchase Timing:**
- Spring (March-April): Preparing for season
- Late summer (August): After harvest, planning for next year
- Avoid winter (November-January): Low beekeeping activity

**Budget Holders:**
- Self-funded from beekeeping profits
- Sometimes reinvests honey sales revenue
- Occasionally takes small business loan

## Acquisition Channels
