## Profile

Urban beekeepers keep 1-5 hives in city environments (rooftops, balconies, small gardens). Similar to hobby beekeepers but with unique urban constraints around neighbors and space.

### Demographics
- Age: 30-55
- Location: City centers, urban residential areas
- Income: Middle to upper-middle class
- Education: Often higher education, environmentally conscious
- Property: Apartment with rooftop access, house with small garden

### Operation Scale
- **1-5 beehives** (typically 1-2)
- Single location (rooftop, balcony, small yard)
- Limited space for equipment
- Small-scale honey production (personal use + gifts)
- Focus on environmental impact over production

## Unique Urban Constraints

### Neighbor Concerns
- **Swarm prevention critical** - Swarms cause panic in urban areas
- Aggressive behavior complaints
- Fear of stings (especially with children nearby)
- Building management permissions required
- Need to demonstrate responsible beekeeping

### Space Limitations
- Limited room for hive equipment
- Can't easily expand number of hives
- Storage for extraction equipment challenging
- Inspection area must be compact
- Rooftop access may be restricted

### Accessibility Challenges
- Hives may be on roof 3-5 stories up
- Heavy lifting up/down stairs difficult
- Inspection timing constrained by building access
- Weather/wind more exposed on rooftops
- Limited water access for bees

## Motivations

1. **Environmental Impact** - Urban biodiversity, pollination
2. **Learning** - Understanding bees and nature
3. **Local Food** - Own honey production
4. **Status Symbol** - Unique hobby, conversation starter
5. **Connection to Nature** - Despite urban setting
6. **Community Building** - Urban beekeeping clubs

## Pain Points

### Primary Urban Challenges
- **Swarm anxiety** - Can't let bees swarm in city
- **Neighbor relations** - Need to avoid complaints
- **Inspection difficulty** - Roof access, heavy lifting stairs
- **Space constraints** - Limited equipment storage
- **Visibility concerns** - Others may see/judge beekeeping

### Technical Challenges
- Hard to inspect frequently (roof access)
- Miss swarm preparation signs
- Uncertain about colony health without opening
- Fear of problems escalating unseen
- Want to minimize disturbance

## What They Need from Gratheon

### Critical Features
- **Swarm warnings** - Early detection before preparation
- **Remote monitoring** - Check without roof access
- **Minimal disturbance** - Reduce inspection frequency
- **Peace of mind** - Know bees are healthy without checking
- **Alert system** - Immediate notification of issues

### Urban-Specific Value
- Prevent swarming (avoid neighbor complaints)
- Monitor without multiple roof trips
- Demonstrate responsible beekeeping to neighbors
- Quick problem detection before escalation
- Visual proof of hive health for skeptics

## Product Fit

### Entrance Observer
**Value: VERY HIGH**
- Monitor activity without roof access
- Swarm preparation detection
- Visual proof bees are healthy
- Share footage with curious neighbors
- Worth: €200-300 (high value for urban constraints)

### Beehive Sensors
**Value: MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Remote weight and temperature monitoring
- No need to climb to roof frequently
- Winter survival checking
- Worth: €100-150

### Frame Inspection
**Value: MEDIUM**
- Reduces roof visits
- Internal health checking
- Less relevant for 1-2 hives
- Worth: €150 (nice-to-have)

### Web App
**Value: HIGH**
- Mobile alerts critical
- Historical trends
- Share data with building management if needed
- Essential for remote monitoring

## Buying Behavior

**Budget:** €300-600 per hive acceptable (higher than rural hobby)
**Decision:** Values convenience and peace of mind over cost
**Timing:** Spring setup or when problem occurs
**Influence:** Urban beekeeping meetups, environmental groups

## Acquisition Channels

- Urban beekeeping associations (Berlin, London urban chapters)
- Environmental/sustainability groups
- Rooftop garden communities
- City farming initiatives
- Eco-conscious lifestyle blogs
- Local urban farming stores

## Strategic Importance

### Market Characteristics
- **Growing segment** - Urban beekeeping trend increasing
- **Higher willingness to pay** - Convenience premium
- **Overlap with corporate** - Building rooftops
- **Unique constraints** - Specialized solution needed

### Gratheon Fit
- Remote monitoring solves roof access problem
- Swarm prevention critical (good fit)
- Small-scale focus (1-5 hives matches product)
- Environmental messaging resonates

### Success Metrics (2026)
- 20-30 urban beekeepers in Tallinn/Riga
- €200-400 revenue per beekeeper
- €6k-12k total segment revenue
- Gateway to corporate rooftop programs
