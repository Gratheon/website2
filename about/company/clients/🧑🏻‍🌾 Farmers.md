## Profile

**Priority: ⭐⭐ LOW-MEDIUM (B2B2B Opportunity)**

Farmers are indirect customers who benefit from Gratheon through beekeepers providing pollination services. Not a direct sales target but important ecosystem participant.

### Demographics
- Age: 30-70
- Location: Rural agricultural areas
- Business: Fruit, berry, vegetable crop production
- Farm size: 10-500 hectares
- Crops requiring pollination: Apples, berries, cucumbers, melons

### Daily Reality
- Manage multiple aspects: crops, animals, equipment, workers
- Limited time for specialized activities
- Focus on core farming, not beekeeping
- Technology adoption varies (younger = more tech-savvy)
- Poor internet in remote locations is common

## Motivations

### Primary: Improve Crop Yields
- Better pollination = 20-40% higher yields
- Quality improvement (size, shape of fruit)
- Consistent production year over year
- Meet contract requirements for buyers
- Maximize land productivity

### Secondary: Cost Management
- Predictable pollination costs
- Reduce crop failures
- Meet organic/sustainable certifications
- Access to reliable beekeepers

## Pain Points

### Pollination Challenges
- Finding reliable beekeepers for contracts
- Uncertain colony quality (will they actually pollinate?)
- Timing coordination (bloom window is narrow)
- Trust issues (paying for service, hard to verify)
- Weather and external factors

### Operational Constraints
- Too busy to manage bees themselves
- Don't have beekeeping knowledge
- Can't verify pollination effectiveness
- Dependent on beekeeper availability
- Price negotiations difficult

## Relationship to Gratheon

### Indirect Customer (B2B2B Model)

```
Farmer → Hires → Beekeeper → Uses → Gratheon
   💰           💰            💰
```

**Farmers don't buy Gratheon directly**, but they benefit:
1. Farmer hires beekeeper for pollination service
2. Beekeeper uses Gratheon to manage colonies
3. Gratheon helps beekeeper deliver stronger colonies
4. Farmer gets better pollination results

### Value Chain
- **Farmer pays:** €50-200 per hive per pollination event
- **Beekeeper revenue:** Pollination fees
- **Gratheon revenue:** Subscription/hardware from beekeeper
- **Farmer benefit:** Higher yields (indirect value)

## What Farmers Care About

### From Pollination Service
1. **Colony strength** - Want strong, active bees
2. **Timing** - Deliver during bloom window
3. **Reliability** - Show up as contracted
4. **Proof of service** - Evidence bees are working
5. **Fair pricing** - Competitive rates

### Gratheon's Indirect Value
- Beekeepers using Gratheon can prove colony strength (data/video)
- Better timing through monitoring
- Professionalism signal (tech-enabled service)
- Potentially lower costs (efficient beekeepers)
- Verification of bee activity at farm

## Future Opportunities

### Farmer-Facing Features (Future Product)

**Pollination Verification Dashboard (2027+)**
- Farmer portal showing bee activity at their farm
- Entrance observer data from hives on their property
- Proof of pollination service delivery
- Before/after comparisons
- Transparent reporting

**Benefits:**
- Farmers gain confidence in service
- Beekeepers can charge premium for verified pollination
- Gratheon becomes platform connecting farmers + beekeepers
- Three-way value creation

### Partnership Models

**With Beekeepers:**
- Offer "farmer reporting" as premium beekeeper feature
- Beekeepers share data with farmer clients
- Improves beekeeper-farmer relationships
- Justifies Gratheon investment for beekeepers

**With Farmer Cooperatives:**
- Partner with fruit growers associations
- Bulk pollination coordination
- Certified beekeeper network
- Quality assurance program

## Current Recommendation: INDIRECT ONLY

### Why Not Direct Sales (2026)
1. **Not primary buyers** - Beekeepers are customers
2. **Complex sales** - Would need agricultural sales team
3. **Different needs** - Farm management focus, not beekeeping
4. **Distraction** - Focus on beekeeper success first
5. **Network effects** - Better beekeepers = happy farmers automatically

### Strategic Approach
- **Enable beekeepers** to serve farmers better
- Consider "farmer reporting" as beekeeper feature (2027)
- Build relationships through beekeeper success stories
- Monitor for farmer-initiated requests
- Potential partnerships with ag-tech platforms

## Success Metrics

**Indirect Impact (via Beekeepers):**
- Number of pollination contracts using Gratheon-enabled beekeepers
- Farmer satisfaction with Gratheon-using beekeepers
- Testimonials from farmers about pollination quality
- Beekeeper upsell rate for "farmer reporting" feature

**Note:** Farmers are important stakeholders in the beekeeping ecosystem but not a direct sales target for Gratheon in 2026. Focus remains on beekeepers who serve farmers. Consider farmer-facing features in 2027+ after beekeeper product is mature.
