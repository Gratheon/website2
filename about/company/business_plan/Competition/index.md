This is a list of great apps, devices, code repos and products that we look at for inspiration and competitive intelligence.

## Competitive Landscape Overview

The precision beekeeping market is validated and growing, with competitors across multiple segments:
- **Robotic apiaries** - Full automation (enterprise market)
- **Entrance observers** - Computer vision monitoring (Gratheon's direct competition)
- **IoT sensors** - Basic monitoring (established market)
- **Web apps** - Digital hive management (software-only)

### Top 5 Direct Competitors
1. **🇩🇪 ApicAI** - MOST DIRECT THREAT (entrance observer, €350-550, European market)
2. **🇮🇱 BeeHero** - Well-funded IoT platform (expanding to Europe)
3. **🇮🇱 Beewise** - Market leader in robotics (enterprise segment)
4. **🇨🇦 Nectar** - Strong web app UX (software competition)
5. **Broodminder** - Established sensors (entry-level competition)

### Gratheon's Competitive Advantages
- **Frame-level internal inspection** (unique, no competitor offers this)
- **Integrated ecosystem** (entrance + frame + sensors + app)
- **Middle market pricing** (€200-400 vs €350-550)
- **European focus** (local advantage)
- **Open source approach** (community trust)

### Key Strategic Insights
- Speed to market is critical (launch before ApicAI expands features)
- Frame inspection is strongest differentiator
- European semi-pros are underserved market segment
- Hardware + software integration creates competitive moat
- Community building and partnerships essential
