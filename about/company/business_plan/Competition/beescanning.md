## Overview

BeeScanning appears to focus on QR code-based hive identification and tracking, offering a mobile-friendly approach to hive management.

## Product Features (Inferred)
- QR code generation for hives
- Mobile scanning capabilities
- Digital hive identification
- Record keeping via scan-to-log
- Mobile-first approach
- Quick inspection logging

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- Innovative QR code approach for hive identification
- Mobile-first design (convenient for field use)
- Low-tech hardware (just QR codes, not sensors)
- Quick inspection logging workflow
- Easy to implement (print QR codes)
- Low cost solution
- Works offline (scan then sync)

### Weaknesses vs Gratheon
- No automated monitoring (still manual)
- No IoT sensors or real-time data
- No computer vision or AI
- Limited to what beekeeper manually enters
- QR codes can fade/damage in outdoor conditions
- No predictive analytics
- Still requires physical inspections

### Strategic Implications
- Shows beekeepers want mobile-friendly solutions
- QR code approach is clever for identification
- Manual entry still required (pain point)
- Gratheon could incorporate QR codes for hive ID
- Mobile-first UX is important learning
- Low-tech bridge between traditional and automated

## Market Position
- Niche solution (QR code focus)
- Bridge between paper records and full automation
- Appeals to cost-conscious beekeepers

## Competitive Strategy
- Gratheon can offer optional QR code integration
- Position as "beyond QR codes" with automation
- Mobile app must be excellent (match their convenience)
- Consider QR codes as backup identification method

## Lessons for Gratheon
- Mobile-first UX is critical for field use
- Quick logging workflows matter
- Hive identification/labeling is important
- Consider QR codes as supplementary feature
- Offline functionality valued by beekeepers
- Low-friction data entry is competitive advantage
