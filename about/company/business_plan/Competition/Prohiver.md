## Overview

Prohiver is an IoT sensor platform for beehive monitoring, targeting semi-professional beekeepers with basic monitoring capabilities.

## Product Features (Typical IoT Sensors)
- Temperature monitoring
- Humidity sensors
- Hive weight tracking
- Wireless connectivity
- Mobile app
- Data visualization
- Alert notifications
- Battery powered

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- IoT sensor platform (proven technology)
- Semi-professional target market (same as Gratheon)
- European presence (likely)
- Affordable sensor approach
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Mobile app access
- Low power consumption

### Weaknesses vs Gratheon
- No computer vision capabilities
- No entrance monitoring

- No AI/ML predictive analytics
- Limited innovation
- No automated image analysis

### Strategic Implications
- Direct competitor in semi-pro IoT sensor market
- Similar target audience to Gratheon
- Basic sensors are table stakes
- Gratheon's computer vision is differentiator
- Monitor their feature additions
- Potential integration partner for sensors
- Price competitively against their offering

## Market Position
- Mid-tier IoT sensor provider
- Semi-professional market
- Europe-focused (likely)
- Basic monitoring solution

## Competitive Strategy
- Offer Gratheon sensor compatibility
- Emphasize computer vision advantage
- Position as "sensors + intelligence"
- Highlight frame inspection uniqueness
- Consider sensor integration/compatibility

## Lessons for Gratheon
- Basic sensors are expected baseline
- Semi-professional market is viable
- European target is correct
- Mobile app is essential
- Real-time alerts are table stakes
- Need differentiation beyond basic sensors

## Differentiation for Gratheon
- Add computer vision (they don't have)
- Frame-level inspection (unique)
- AI/ML predictive models
- Integrated ecosystem approach
- Visual data beats sensor data alone
