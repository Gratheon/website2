## Overview

Purple Hive is an Australian project focused specifically on varroa mite detection using computer vision. Uses dual cameras (top and bottom) for comprehensive mite monitoring.

## Product Features
- Focus on varroa mite detection from 2 video cameras (top and bottom)
- NOT a bee counter (specialized use case)
- Makes photo every 1 second
- Low power consumption
- 3D printed outer case (ABS plastic)
- SMS notification system
- 4G connectivity
- Solar powered (autonomous operation)

## Technical Specifications
- Dual camera setup for better mite detection
- Edge processing for privacy and low bandwidth
- Image capture every second (high frequency)
- Designed for Australian biosecurity context

## Competitive Analysis

### Strengths
- Specialized focus on critical problem (varroa)
- Dual camera approach (more comprehensive than single entrance camera)
- Solar powered (excellent for remote locations)
- Low power design (practical for field deployment)
- SMS notifications (works without internet)
- 4G connectivity (no WiFi required)
- 3D printed case (cost-effective, customizable)

### Weaknesses vs Gratheon
- Single-purpose device (varroa only, not general monitoring)
- NOT a bee counter (limited functionality)
- Australia-focused (varroa recently arrived there)
- Smaller project (less funding/resources)
- Limited to entrance monitoring
- No internal frame inspection

### Strategic Implications
- Validates importance of varroa detection features
- Dual camera approach is interesting (consider for Gratheon)
- Solar power and low-power design are valuable lessons
- SMS fallback is smart for connectivity issues
- Geographic separation (Australia vs Europe)
- Could partner for varroa detection algorithms
- Gratheon can offer more comprehensive solution (counting + varroa + more)

## Lessons for Gratheon
- Varroa detection is critical feature to include
- Consider solar power option for remote apiaries
- SMS notifications as backup to app notifications
- Low power consumption extends deployment options
- 3D printed cases can reduce hardware costs
