## Pricing
Our main revenue stream is [web_app](../../products/web_app/web_app.md) SaaS data analytics services with flat or usage based pricing. For hardware, we want to keep prices relatively low, to have maximum adoption rate, promoting subscription model.

## Order of product development
 [robotic_beehive](../../products/robotic_beehive/robotic_beehive.md) is the expensive to research and manufacture for the mass-market.
 
To reduce risks, we develop simultaneously our base products:
- [web_app](../../products/web_app/web_app.md)
- [scales](../../products/scales/scales.md)
- [entrance_observer](../../products/entrance_observer/entrance_observer.md)
