# Radiate truth 🌞

Be joyful and honest, have fun. Be open and transparent to the world. Communicate to reduce boundaries, complexity, be predictable to be trusted.

## What this means in practice

**Radical transparency:** We operate with the belief that transparency builds trust faster than any marketing strategy. When beekeepers can see exactly how our algorithms work, they trust the insights we provide.

**Honest communication:** We admit mistakes quickly, share both successes and failures, and give realistic timelines. If a feature won't be ready, we say so upfront rather than making promises we can't keep.

**Joyful problem-solving:** We approach challenges with curiosity rather than stress. Debugging a sensor issue or optimizing an algorithm should feel like solving an interesting puzzle, not a burden.

## Behavioral expectations

- **Default to public:** Share your work, learnings, and even failures openly unless there's a specific reason not to
- **Admit uncertainty:** Say "I don't know" when you don't know, then commit to finding out
- **Celebrate mistakes:** When something breaks, focus on learning and improvement rather than blame
- **Simplify communication:** Explain complex concepts in ways that beekeepers without technical backgrounds can understand

## Examples in action

- Publishing research papers about our bee detection algorithms so the scientific community can build upon our work
- Live-streaming debugging sessions when production systems have issues
- Sharing exact revenue numbers and growth metrics publicly
- Creating educational content that explains how machine learning helps identify bee diseases

## Also
Do not lie
Do not be gloomy

## Examples
- We are open - open source code, [open hardware](https://www.openhardware.io/), open datasets
- Our internal communication is public
	- Discord chats
	- Youtube meetings
- We do not separate company data into `secret`, `confidential`, `internal`, `restricted` levels. All data is considered public
