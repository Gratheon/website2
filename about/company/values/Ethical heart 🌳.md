# Ethical heart 🌳

Care about sentient organisms. Go beyond product to have sustainable ecosystem and environment. Balance work and life.

## What this means in practice

**Bee welfare first:** Every product decision must consider its impact on bee health and colony survival. We're not just extracting data from beehives - we're actively contributing to bee conservation and sustainable beekeeping practices.

**Environmental stewardship:** Our technology should help create a more sustainable world. This means building energy-efficient systems, supporting regenerative agriculture, and considering the carbon footprint of our operations.

**Human sustainability:** Team members are whole people with lives outside work. We design our culture and processes to support long-term career growth without burning people out.

**Ethical data use:** Bee colony data reveals intimate details about agricultural practices and environmental conditions. We handle this information with respect for both the bees and the beekeepers who trust us.

## Behavioral expectations

- **Question the purpose:** Before building features, ask whether they truly benefit bee populations or just create more data
- **Consider long-term impact:** Evaluate decisions based on their effects over years, not just quarters
- **Respect natural cycles:** Understand that beekeeping follows seasonal patterns and biological rhythms that can't be optimized away
- **Protect privacy:** Treat beekeeper data as confidential even when they're willing to share it publicly
- **Work sustainably:** Take breaks, use vacation time, and speak up when workload becomes unsustainable

## Examples in action

- Declining a lucrative contract that would involve practices harmful to bee colonies
- Building predictive models that help beekeepers reduce pesticide use rather than optimize it
- Choosing renewable energy providers for data centers and offices
- Implementing features that help beekeepers identify and protect native bee species alongside honeybees
- Flexible work arrangements that accommodate team members' personal responsibilities

## Sustainability principles

- **Regenerative impact:** Leave ecosystems better than we found them
- **Circular economy:** Design products for reuse, repair, and recycling
- **Local knowledge:** Value indigenous and traditional beekeeping wisdom
- **Biodiversity support:** Consider impact on all pollinators, not just managed honeybees

## Work-life integration

- **Boundaries:** Respect time zones and personal time
- **Mental health:** Provide resources and support for psychological well-being
- **Growth paths:** Offer career development that doesn't require sacrificing personal life
- **Purpose alignment:** Ensure everyone understands how their work contributes to bee conservation
