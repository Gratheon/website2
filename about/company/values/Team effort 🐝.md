# Team effort 🐝

Be part of the collective, make friends, communicate, lead by example, equal voice, disagree and commit.

## What this means in practice

**Collective intelligence:** Like bees in a hive, our individual contributions combine to create something greater than the sum of our parts. A data scientist's insights + a beekeeper's domain knowledge + an engineer's implementation = revolutionary solutions.

**Distributed leadership:** Leadership isn't about titles - it's about stepping up when your expertise is needed. The person closest to a problem often has the best solution.

**Productive conflict:** We welcome disagreement because it leads to better decisions. The goal isn't harmony, it's finding the best path forward through honest debate.

**Shared ownership:** Team victories and failures belong to everyone. When we succeed at helping a beekeeper save their hives, we all celebrate. When we miss a deadline, we all take responsibility.

## Behavioral expectations

- **Assume positive intent:** When someone disagrees with you, assume they want the same good outcome but see a different path
- **Make others successful:** Actively help teammates achieve their goals
- **Share credit generously:** Highlight others' contributions in team meetings and communications
- **Communicate across boundaries:** Don't let departments become silos - actively collaborate with people outside your immediate team
- **Commit fully:** Once a team decision is made, support it even if it wasn't your preferred option

## Examples in action

- A junior developer spots a critical bug that senior engineers missed → the team celebrates the catch and improves the review process
- Marketing and engineering collaborate to create educational content that both attracts customers and showcases technical expertise
- Product disagreements are resolved through user testing rather than internal politics
- Remote and in-person team members get equal voice in decisions through structured communication

## Collaboration patterns

- **Swarm problem-solving:** When facing complex issues, multiple people contribute different perspectives
- **Knowledge pollination:** Regular cross-team presentations to share learnings
- **Mentorship circles:** Senior members actively develop junior team members
- **Retrospective improvement:** Regular team reflection on what's working and what isn't
