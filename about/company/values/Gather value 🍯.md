# Gather value 🍯

Bring value, create symbiotic relations, enrich all parties. We bring value to beekeepers and to our team. Grow wider in your abilities and knowledge to bring more impact.

## What this means in practice

**For beekeepers:** We don't just collect data - we transform it into actionable insights that improve hive health, increase honey yields, and reduce colony losses. Every feature we build must solve a real problem that beekeepers face.

**For our team:** Personal growth directly translates to company impact. When you learn new skills, you become more valuable to clients and teammates. We invest in your development because it creates a positive feedback loop.

**For partnerships:** We seek win-win relationships. Whether with research institutions, equipment manufacturers, or other tech companies, we aim for collaborations where all parties benefit and grow together.

## Behavioral expectations

- **Question the "why":** Before building features, ask how they create measurable value for beekeepers
- **Share knowledge:** Teach teammates new skills you've learned - it multiplies our collective capability
- **Measure impact:** Track how your work translates to better outcomes for hives and beekeepers
- **Think ecosystem:** Consider how your decisions affect the entire beekeeping community, not just immediate users

## Examples in action

- A data scientist learns computer vision → enables automated varroa mite detection → saves beekeepers hundreds of inspection hours
- Our open-source sensor designs → other companies build compatible hardware → beekeepers get more affordable options
- Revenue growth → better compensation and benefits → team stays motivated and productive

## Also
Do not be greedy
Do not do random things

## Examples
We are for-profit so that employees can be well compensated
