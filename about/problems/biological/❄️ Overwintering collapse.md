Bees can die over the winter if they are too weak as they cannot warm themselves and its brood.
Usually beekeepers do not know what was the cause and blame themselves for the death - its [🎒 Challenging to become a new beekeeper](../🎒%20Challenging%20to%20become%20a%20new%20beekeeper.md), and beekeeping is a long process to master.

Overwintering may be an aggregate result of different causes:
- [🦀 Infestations](🦀%20Infestations.md) and [🦀 Diseases](🦀%20Diseases.md)- mites severely weaken the colony and it can freeze over the winter
- [🍽️ Bee colony starvation](🍽️%20Bee%20colony%20starvation.md), but it is possible to find dead colonies packed with honey
- [🗃️ Poor hive ventilation](../🗃️%20Poor%20hive%20ventilation.md) - can cause mold and freezing microclimate inside of the hive

Collapsed bee colony affects also bee frames, making honey no longer digestable, polluting frames and the hive with fungi, viral and bacterial infections
