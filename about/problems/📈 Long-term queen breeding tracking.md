Beekeepers focused on breeding queens in clean conditions (ex. on an island), might be interested in survival or behaviour development of their "product" after sales. Currently it might be hard to track such information.

With Gratheon app, users could share ( [♻️ Hive ownership transfer](../products/web_app/pro-tier/ideas%20💡/♻️%20Hive%20ownership%20transfer.md) ) queen/hive information with original owner to automatically provide information on colony development
