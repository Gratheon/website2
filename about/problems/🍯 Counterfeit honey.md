Counterfeit honey has become a growing challenge for beekeepers, consumers, and the entire apiculture industry. This problem arises when honey products are adulterated with cheaper sweeteners like corn syrup, rice syrup, or other non-natural additives. Some counterfeit honey is even produced entirely synthetically, bypassing bees altogether. This fraudulent practice not only undermines the hard work of ethical beekeepers but also devalues the purity and quality of real honey. For consumers, the consequences include unwittingly purchasing products with little nutritional value, potentially harmful chemicals, and none of the beneficial enzymes and nutrients that genuine honey provides. On a larger scale, the prevalence of counterfeit honey erodes trust in the market, making it harder for ethical producers to compete and sustain their livelihoods.

### 60-90% of honey in supermarkets is fake

According to Celvia and https://mda-test.com/, honey state in supermarkets is not original

## Potential solutions

Gratheon is committed to tackling this issue head-on by empowering beekeepers with advanced tools to authenticate and trace the origin of their honey.  We do not have immediate solution to such problem nor do we want to be a certification authority. We do however want to empower beekeepers to technically track honey composition over time. Our goal is to manage data about colony behaviour, pollination and honey as a result without going into trust or honey sale processes. Ideally, we would want to have a built-in robotic automated honey DNA analysis module.
