# Problems we are solving

> 💡 Hard, frequent, unscalable work to keep bees healthy for precise pollination and food security

Bees are essential for global food security, with over 35% of food production depending on pollination. However, modern beekeeping faces complex, interconnected challenges that traditional methods struggle to address at scale.

## The Core Challenge

Traditional beekeeping requires constant [👁️ Observability of bee colony](core/👁️%20Observability%20of%20bee%20colony.md) through [💪🏻 Physical labor](core/💪🏻%20Physical%20labor.md) and [👁️ Time-consuming inspections](👁️%20Time-consuming%20inspections.md). This approach becomes [💪🏻 Unscalable work](core/💪🏻%20Unscalable%20work.md) as operations grow, especially for [👨🏻‍🚒 Industrial beekeepers](../company/clients/👨🏻‍🚒%20Industrial%20beekeepers.md) managing [🏘️ Multiple apiaries](systemic/🏘️%20Multiple%20apiaries.md) at [🌲 Distant locations](systemic/🌲%20Distant%20locations.md).

## Our Approach: Technology + Ethics

Unlike solutions that focus solely on data collection, we prioritize:

- **Bee welfare first:** Technology should reduce stress on colonies, not increase it
- **Practical impact:** Focus on problems that beekeepers actually face daily
- **Scalable solutions:** Address root causes that prevent industry growth
- **Open innovation:** Share knowledge to benefit the entire beekeeping community


> **Note:** We maintain a detailed problem database to link specific issues with solution features. This systematic approach ensures our technology development addresses real beekeeping challenges rather than theoretical problems.
