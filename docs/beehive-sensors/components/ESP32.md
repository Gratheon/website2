ESP32 Breakout Board GPIO 1 into 2 + ESP32 CP2102 NodeMCU-32S Lua 30Pin GPIO WiFi+Bluetooth-compatible Development Board

**Feature:**

**1. Versatile and Powerful:**

The ESP WROOM 32 is a powerful WiFi-BT-BLE MCU module suitable for various applications, from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks like voice coding, music streaming, and MP3 decoding. Its core is the ESP32S chip, which is designed for scalability and adaptability. It has two CPU cores that can be controlled or powered independently, with clock frequencies adjustable between 80 MHz and 240 MHz.

**2. Rich Peripheral Integration:**

The ESP32S integrates rich peripherals, including capacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, low-noise sensor amplifiers, for SD card interfaces, Ethernet, high-speed SDIO/SPI, UART, and I2C. This makes it an excellent choice for projects that require many different types of sensors and interfaces.

**3. Dual-mode WiFi and Bluetooth-compatible:**

This circuit board uses the 2.4 GHz dual-mode WiFi and Bluetooth-compatible chip ESP-WROOM-32, with 40-nanometer low-power technology. This combination delivers both fast wireless internet connectivity and low-power Bluetooth-compatible communication capabilities.

**4. Stable Design:**

The expansion board features a two-layer design with a single pin on each side, providing stable and reliable contact and signal transmission for your ESP32 board. This design ensures that data transfer is consistent and reliable, even under tough conditions.

**5. GPIO Expansion:**

The splitter board allows you to expand one GPIO pin of your ESP32 development board into two, making it a good tool for your smart home project. With this board, you can reuse all of your pins without sacrificing performance, making it an excellent alternative to other options on the market.
